## Introduction

Laravel Socialite provides an expressive, fluent interface to OAuth authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub and Bitbucket. It handles almost all of the boilerplate social authentication code you are dreading writing.

**We are not accepting new adapters.**

**If you are using Laravel 5.3 or below, please use [Socialite 2.0](https://github.com/laravel/socialite/tree/2.0).**

Adapters for other platforms are listed at the community driven [Socialite Providers](https://socialiteproviders.github.io/) website.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Socialite can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/socialite).
